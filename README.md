This is a Phase 5 Capstone Project for Flatiron School's Datascience Bootcamp. I created a real time object detection application where a user can upload an image, video, or opt to use real time detection via a webcam of their car, truck, bus, motorcycle, van or tricycle or a picture of the class to have the model detect it in a given photo or video. I trained a YOLO v8 nano model on a traffic image dataset on 6 different classes to learn complex heuristics between each class. The frontend is written in HTML and styled using CSS and the backend is written in python using Flask.
