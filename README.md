This is a Phase 5 Capstone Project for Flatiron School's Datascience Bootcamp. I created a real time object detection application where a user can upload an image, video, or opt to use real time detection via a webcam of their car, truck, bus, motorcycle, van or tricycle or a picture of the class to have the model detect it in a given photo or video. I trained a YOLO v8 nano model on a traffic image dataset on 6 different classes to learn complex heuristics between each class. The frontend is written in HTML and styled using CSS and the backend is written in python using Flask. 

### How to Use

Once you are at the homepage, you can either select to upload an image of a vehicle, upload a video, or use your webcam for real time detection. Select the image you want to detect and click on upload image and detect.
